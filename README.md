# dotfiles

my configuration files for some programs

## setup

installing suckless software is optional, however when installed the source for the programs is automatically cloned and compiled to `~/.local/src/`

```
$ git clone https://github.com/synthun/dotfiles
$ cd dotfiles
$ chmod +x setup
$ ./setup
```

## suckless configs

- [dwm](https://github.com/synthun/dwm)
- [dmenu](https://github.com/synthun/dmenu)
- [st](https://github.com/synthun/dwm)

## dependencies (only for installing suckless)
